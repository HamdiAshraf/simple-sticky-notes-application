Create a simple sticky notes application which consists of two pages:

1- A page which contains a form to add a new note
2- A page which displays all the notes, and a link to the other page

Use MongoDB to store the notes.
Use HTML templates (EJS, Pug, or any of your choice) to render the views for notes.
